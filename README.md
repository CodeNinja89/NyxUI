NyxUI
=====

User Interface in HTML5/CSS3/jQuery.

Just trying some UI for my Ubuntu tablet. There is a scarcity of space as well as processing power on the tablet so the 
UI should be as lightweight as possible. A small HTML5 music player app complete with playlist and all is done and working.
The backend will be done in C (since it is my "mother toungue", so deal with it) or Perl.
